the arguments necessary for the program to operate should be writen in the command line
python main.py k initial_node destination_node

k is the number of iterations of the k-shortest-path
initial_node should be a number
destination_node should also be a number

example: python main.py 2 1 3

the algorithm will try to find 2 shortest path from the node 1 to node 3


following is the table of each number corresponding to the locations in the ipe network to the locations

0: teste
1: brasilia
2: lalalal
3: lalalalla
